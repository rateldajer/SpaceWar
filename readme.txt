## Purpose and Statement on Previous Intellectual Property
This repository is of Prof. Mark Crowley and his Machine Learning research lab at the University of Waterloo (https://markcrowley.ca).
We have no intention of stealing the original intellectual property of this game. It was originally (as far as I know) a game on the old Palm Pilot OS and then MageKing17 posted up this version of it which he made. We aim to develop a new version compatible with the OpenAIGym API for use in training Reinforcement Learning agents. The game has some unique multiplayer properties and yet is simple enough to make mastery possible. If you had some part in developing the orginal code and have issue with our project please feel free to contact Mark Crowley and we'd be happy to discuss it (mcrowley@uwaterloo.ca).
